## General info
Another fun color dropdown style web design. If you haven't seen my other one created using Vue.js [here](https://vue-color-dropdown.netlify.app/) it is along with the git [repo](https://github.com/ibsaajadam/vue-ColorDropdown). But I really just thought this was a nice and simply way to learn JavaScript. I also see why so many people love Bootstrap as the designs are nice and easy to implement. 

So for the site you have an input field where you enter a color. If the color you enter is in the database of colors I created a circle will appear below the input field showing you the color you selected. If we do not have the color you selected you will see a 'Sorry, color not found' pop up. Also there is a button below the field that shows you different colors to enter or click if none of the colors you are entering work.

Overall had fun creating this site. Though I do want to work on JavaScript more.

Thanks for viewing!

* Continue to improve my JavaScript skills and see what more Bootstrap has to offer. Also continue working on my media queries and making my projects cleaner as you scale up and down.
